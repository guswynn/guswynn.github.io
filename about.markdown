## How I made this blog
I just use Jekyll and github pages:

### Github Pages:

[Using Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)

### Jekyll
This is the default Jekyll theme. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)

You can find the source code for Jekyll at GitHub:
[jekyll][jekyll-organization] /
[jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)

_I highly recommend using `brew`'s `ruby@2.7` to use jekyll right now_
